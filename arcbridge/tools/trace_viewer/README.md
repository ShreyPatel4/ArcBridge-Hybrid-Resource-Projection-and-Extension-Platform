# ArcBridge Trace Viewer (POC)

This directory contains scripts for exploring OpenTelemetry traces emitted by the agent and control plane.

- `otel-collector.docker-compose.yaml`: Placeholder docker-compose definition for spinning up the collector and Jaeger.
- `query.sh`: Example script demonstrating how to query traces once Jaeger is available.

Future work: integrate with Azure Monitor or Grafana Tempo.
